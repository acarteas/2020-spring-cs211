*  Starting this assignment was really challenging because my work from the other project (that was a complete a total flop), it was really hard
to start with a new project, even though it was clean, I'm having trouble still orienting through the framework and troubleshooting my issues. I feel 
really dependent still on help, and it is frustrating because I want to be more self-sufficient as I love programming, but it is extremely difficult
when I can't get very far by myself or working on a error code, and googling it for hours.
