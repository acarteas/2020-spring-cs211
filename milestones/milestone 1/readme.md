* Maintaining a [design diary](../design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)
* Completing the project / making reasonable progress

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, January 31, 2020.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github and by submitting a link to that repository on Canvas. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in _the root folder_ of your repository!*
