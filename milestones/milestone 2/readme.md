# Milestone #2
In this milestone, you will extend your first milestone by extending your basic card game framework into a game of blackjack.  

## Basic Functional Requirements
1. Your game needs to implement a [standard dealer AI](https://www.888casino.com/blog/blackjack-strategy-guide/how-to-play-blackjack)
2. Your game should use a C# ```List``` data structure for holding one or more decks
3. Your game should allow the user to specify the number of decks that will be used
4. Players should have a "bank" of money which they can bet from

### Advanced Functional Requirements
1. Your game allows players to "double down" or "split" their bet when appropriate
2. Your game allows players to take insurance and give appropriate bonus payout for blackjack
3. Your game allows for "multiple players" (more than one player deck on same screen)

### Super Advanced Functional Requirements 
1. Your game supports networked multiplayer
2. Your game supports a Player AI that can count cards and uses an intelligent betting system.  Consider reading up on [AI/ML in C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai).

## Basic Design Requirements 
1. Your cards should have proper front (visible) and back (hidden) art. https://opengameart.org has some great free art that you can use.  For example, see [this](https://opengameart.org/content/casino-pack) and [this](https://opengameart.org/content/colorful-poker-card-back)

### Advanced Design Requirements
1. Card flips are animated
2. You create a 3D blackjack game
3. You create a unique art style (e.g. retro pixel art or whatever else)


## Grading
This assignment is worth 100 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Completing the basic Functional and Design requirements or making reasonable substitutions from the advanced feature list (check with me first!)
* Using the ```List``` data structure when appropriate
* Regular, appropriately sized github checkins (no single-line checkins, no 1000+ line checkins)
* Maintaining a [design diary](../design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)
* Demonstrating reasonable progress during Lab 3 on February 7, 2020

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, February 14, 2020.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github and by submitting a link to that repository on Canvas. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in _the root folder_ of your repository!*
