While I started this milestone extremly late relative to the due date, I feel my process was on point because I had a fairly good grasp
on the pre-order traversals and the algorithm that we went over in class. I spent at least an hour going over building the tree on paper as
if I was reading it from the file. Next I had a difficult time getting a C# file started without Unity. I'm still working on learining
how to do those things indepently. The hours the were spent getting unity to run and compile was interrupted when I could not even open Unity.
I had to uninstall and reinstall the software. I also learned how to debug better in Unity. I stepped over the lines and stepped into the functions
to look to see if I was on the right question. Logically speaking, there is still some flaws because my leaf nodes are still adding left children. 
I'm almost positive it is in the TakeValue section. I learned more about Top Down design, and I really tried to write helper functions in my code
and leave them be for the time being, and move on to something that I was more comfortable in, so my time was not wasted. I feel like while building
the tree is not complete, I came a long way in the sevearl hours I have worked on it. I feel like I will have a good portion of the requirements 
finished by the time the assignment is due. I still don't have the independent learning that I would like at this point, but I'm picking up on concepts
faster than before, and I can spot little mistakes that prior, I would have not have been able to pick up on otherwise. My programming skills 
are slowly coming together, and my understanding of the runtime complexity, and why certain data structures are better for different situations is becoming
more apparent.

Today I made great progress on getting the rest of the framework for the project taken care of for this milestone. I'm having some issues getting the 
inputs of yes and know to work and I'm not sure if I'm suppose to use a co-routine to get this to work or if I'm supposed to use a different method within 
unity to get this to work. I'm glad I was able to get my preorder traversal built, but I can't really test it to its entirety until I figure out my other bugs.
I feel like I'm getting better at googling and looking at which resources will be vialbe fixes. I also implemented some UI buttons for the yes and the no options
and created prefabs of those objects for future project testing. Learing how to correctly wire up the bottons to the script was a challenge, and I vaguely 
remember doing it with the card deck milestone, but I haven't been as focused on the unity peiece of it as I have been trying to focus on better understanding
the logic and conceputial concepts by using more pseudo code before I sit down and program. I feel like my debugging skills were are constantly improving, 
and I know they will continue to get better. I've noticed that my ability to concentrate for longer periods of time is improving as well. Sometimes, 
I would start to check out when the thought of the logic became too overwhelming. I have started to sit still for longer periods of time, and have more patience
to give myself a better opportunity to slow down, and think about "What am I really trying to do." Getting caught up in the substeps of a function, or the syntax
makes me have a hard time in seeing the bigger picture. Again, I feel that my overall grit and dedication is paying off beacuse I'm becoming more familiar
with the unknown and less frustrated when something doesn't work out as planned.
