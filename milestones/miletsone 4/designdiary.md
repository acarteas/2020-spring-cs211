While I started this milestone extremly late relative to the due date, I feel my process was on point because I had a fairly good grasp
on the pre-order traversals and the algorithm that we went over in class. I spent at least an hour going over building the tree on paper as
if I was reading it from the file. Next I had a difficult time getting a C# file started without Unity. I'm still working on learining
how to do those things indepently. The hours the were spent getting unity to run and compile was interrupted when I could not even open Unity.
I had to uninstall and reinstall the software. I also learned how to debug better in Unity. I stepped over the lines and stepped into the functions
to look to see if I was on the right question. Logically speaking, there is still some flaws because my leaf nodes are still adding left children. 
I'm almost positive it is in the TakeValue section. I learned more about Top Down design, and I really tried to write helper functions in my code
and leave them be for the time being, and move on to something that I was more comfortable in, so my time was not wasted. I feel like while building
the tree is not complete, I came a long way in the sevearl hours I have worked on it. I feel like I will have a good portion of the requirements 
finished by the time the assignment is due. I still don't have the independent learning that I would like at this point, but I'm picking up on concepts
faster than before, and I can spot little mistakes that prior, I would have not have been able to pick up on otherwise. My programming skills 
are slowly coming together, and my understanding of the runtime complexity, and why certain data structures are better for different situations is becoming
more apparent.
